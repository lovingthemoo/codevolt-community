# CodeVolt Community

Welcome to the CodeVolt community hub! This is where we discuss ideas, request tools, and share feedback.

## What is CodeVolt?

CodeVolt builds electric, high-performance developer tools. We focus on:

- **Server price monitoring** — Track AWS, Azure, GCP pricing
- **DevOps automation** — Production-tested scripts and configurations
- **Security tooling** — Practical security for real-world deployments

## Ways to Participate

### 💡 Request a Tool

Have an idea for a developer tool? [Open a tool request](../../issues/new?template=tool_request.yml)

We prioritize requests based on:
- Community demand (👍 reactions)
- Alignment with CodeVolt's mission
- Feasibility and scope

### 🗣️ Start a Discussion

Share ideas, ask questions, and connect with the community:

- **[Tool Requests](../../discussions/categories/tool-requests)** — Request new tools or features
- **[Q&A](../../discussions/categories/q-a)** — Get help and ask questions
- **[General Discussion](../../discussions/categories/general)** — Share ideas and community chat
- **[Show and Tell](../../discussions/categories/show-and-tell)** — Share what you've built

### 🐛 Report Bugs

**Per-tool bug reporting** — Each tool has its own isolated issue area:

| Tool | Bug Report Link |
|------|-----------------|
| **PriceVolt** | [Report PriceVolt Bug](../../issues/new?template=bug_report_pricevolt.yml) |
| **Newsletter/Website** | [Report General Bug](../../issues/new?template=bug_report_general.yml) |

**Why isolated?** Keeps issues organised by tool, makes tracking easier, prevents cross-tool confusion.
